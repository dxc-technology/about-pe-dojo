## Online Product Engineering Dojo - FAQ

#### I'm trying to right click copy a selection of text in Firefox but it isn't giving me the option to copy.

A. Firefox has been completely re-engineered since we created the Katacoda scenarios and this is something that they've broken. Please try using another browser, we recommend using Chrome, while some users report success with Edge.

#### I walked away from my training, and now it's timed out, why can't I just pick up where I left off?

A. Katacoda need to protect their resources, and that's one of the things that helps them offer training at a reasonable cost. Idle sessions tie up resources on their back end, and to prevent resource starvation they time out sessions; so if this happens to you then you'll need to start over.

Hopefully the previous practice will help get you back to where you left off pretty quickly. The [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in Katacoda is about a pattern of moves that are repeated to build familiarity, so repetition is helpful to learning.
